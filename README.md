# Lesson 1
### beats
* six-count (rock n' roll)
	- rock step + pump (instead of the side we do front heel)
	- rock step + triple step
* eight count (classic swing - extra step+step)
* charleston 20s
	- the one with the semicircles
	- scissors (in-out the backs - keep weight on balls of the feet)
* charleston 40s
	- rock-step, kick-down, kick-up, kick, down
* hand 2 hand
	- kick and kick (simplified charleston with turns)

### moves
* bust-outs (eight beet rythms)
	- both facing front + walking
	- follow bust out (I bring her front)
	- lead bust out (I come to the front)
	- side bust out both of us facing each other, forcing her to take a side step like me
	- butterfly (bust out w/ a twist) - turn in the end half a circle for the step+step, before going back the same way as you came
* swing-out
	- circle -> swingout from open to closed
	- swing out from open to open (the classic swing-out)

### Remember!
* tension in the arms + body
* linear movement during swing out
* bust outs "feel the step" - let the ground absorb it (especially in the change of direction)

# Lesson 2
### moves
* Tandem
  * entry
    * super simple
    * from side by side with the palm push
    * 'tricky' step entry
  * in-tandem moves
    * butterfly with push on 3 on left shoulder (half turn follow)
    * butterfly push on right shoulder hand switch (full turn follow)
    * turn for both
    * corridors (the one I did not get)
  * exit
    * hand to hand, 'ooooo', backstep + lindy turn (optional)

# Lesson 3:
* lindy turn / swing out
  * inside turn (looking at the watch)
  * outside turn
  * free turn (same as outside, just no hands)
  * texas tommy
  * fake texas tommy (absorb the movement of the follow on the 5)
  * fake lindy turn (keep hands near her body on switch from 5 to 6)
* Remember:
  * stay relaxed
  * stay grounded
  * focus on moving body (ignore follow & steps)
  * make sure the rock step is subtle but clear (achieved by moving one's body)

# Lesson 4: revision

# Lesson 5:
  * Kick-ball-change instead of rock step
  * Sweep floor at 7+8
  * 5-6 with 5 lasting less and 6 more while stretching your body upwards
  * Rockstep with 2 being a jump and fitting an extra, fat step when landing and moving on
  * "Scissors" on 7,8,1,2, and then triple step
